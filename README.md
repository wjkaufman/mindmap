# MindMap

Playing with an idea to create helpful maps of knowledge and recommending what to study.

To run locally: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`.

## TODO

- figure out how to save JSON files
- add buttons to add nodes, links between nodes
- add more data to nodes, like topic, when I studied it, etc.
