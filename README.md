# MindMap

Playing with an idea to create helpful maps of knowledge and recommending what to study.

To run locally: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`.

## TODO

- add feature to add nodes, links between nodes
    - **currently working on**: currently need to add only a single circle/line, but with the rest of the simulation
- add more data to nodes, like topic, when I studied it, etc.
